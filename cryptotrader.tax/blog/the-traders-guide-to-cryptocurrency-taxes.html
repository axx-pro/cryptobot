However, as the IRS continues to <a href="irs-sending-more-cryptocurrency-warning-letters.html"><strong>crack down</strong></a> on crypto tax compliance, it’s becoming increasingly important to learn about how cryptocurrencies are taxed. <br/></p><p>In this guide, we discuss everything you need to know about cryptocurrency taxes. From the high level tax implications to the actual tax forms you need to fill out, you’ll learn all about what you need to stay compliant and get your taxes done properly.<br/></p><p>This guide was created by the tax team at <a href="../index.html"><strong>CryptoTrader.Tax</strong></a> — Today, over 100,000 crypto investors use CryptoTrader.Tax to properly report their cryptocurrency taxes. You can create a <a href="https://app.cryptotrader.tax/account/register"><strong>free account here</strong></a>. <br/></p><p><em>This guide breaks down the specific crypto tax implications within the U.S. You can see other country-specific tax guides </em><a href="../blog.html"><strong><em>here</em></strong></a><em>. </em></p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../../assets.website-files.com/5f9c358b57fa1ea8ea314144/6083a4e201634f659c96fa80_Crypto%20Tax%20Coins.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></div></figure><h2><em>‍</em>The basics of crypto taxes</h2><p>In the U.S., cryptocurrencies like bitcoin <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions"><strong>are treated</strong></a> as property for tax purposes. <br/></p><p>Just like other forms of property like stocks, bonds, and real-estate, you incur capital gains and capital losses on your cryptocurrency investments when you sell, trade, or otherwise dispose of your crypto.<br/></p><p>For example, if you bought $10,000 worth of bitcoin in October and sold it two months later for $12,000, you would incur a $2,000 capital gain from the sale of your bitcoin (12,000 - 10,000). <br/></p><p>Depending on what tax bracket you fall under, you will pay a certain percentage of tax on this capital gain. Tax rates fluctuate based on your personal <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/tax-brackets.aspx"><strong>tax bracket</strong></a> and whether the gain was short term or long term (more on this later).<br/></p><p>Outside of buying, selling, and trading, if you <em>earn</em> cryptocurrencies—whether through a job, mining, staking, airdrop, or interest from lending activities—you are liable for income taxes on the US Dollar value of your crypto earnings. <br/></p><p>We will walk through examples for all of these scenarios further below.</p><figure style="padding-bottom:42.15456674473068%;max-width:75%;width:75%" class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0zT29RwbGE"></iframe></div></figure><h2>When do you owe taxes on your crypto?</h2><p>Whenever you incur a <a href="when-do-you-owe-taxes-on-your-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency.html"><strong>taxable event</strong></a><strong> </strong>from your crypto investing activity, you incur a tax reporting requirement.<br/></p><p>A taxable event simply refers to a scenario in which you <em>trigger or realize</em> income.

In the case of cryptocurrency, this is typically the sale price in USD terms.</p><h3><strong>What is cost basis<br/></strong></h3><p>Cost Basis represents how much money you put into purchasing your property (i.e. how much it <em>cost you</em>). Cost basis includes purchase price plus all other costs associated with purchasing your cryptocurrency (fees, etc).<br/></p><p>From our examples above, it’s easy to see this formula in action. If you buy 1 Litecoin for $250, your cost basis is $250 per Litecoin. If you sell or trade it when it’s worth $400, that $400 is the fair market value. Applying the formula:<br/></p><p>$400 (Fair Market Value) - $250 (Cost Basis) = $150 Gain<br/></p><p>Fairly straightforward.<br/></p><p>Now, let’s dive into a more complex example to see how you would calculate your gains and losses using this same formula when you have a number of transactions instead of just one or two.</p><h3><strong>How to calculate gains and losses</strong></h3><p>Say you have the following transaction history on Coinbase:<br/></p><ul role="list"><li>1/1/20 - Buy 1 BTC for $12,000</li><li>2/2/20 - Buy 1 BTC for $10,000</li><li>3/3/20 - Buy 1 BTC for $8,000</li><li>4/4/20 - Trade 0.5 BTC for 8 ETH (0.5 BTC was worth $4,000 at this time)<br/>‍<br/></li></ul><p>With this transaction history, you first trigger a taxable event (and thus a capital gain/loss) when you trade 0.5 BTC for 8 ETH. To calculate the gain/loss, you need to subtract your cost basis of 0.5 BTC from the fair market value at the time of the trade.<br/></p><p>The question here is, what is your cost basis in the 0.5 BTC that you traded for 8 ETH? After all, you have purchased 3 different bitcoins all at different prices prior to this trade.<br/></p><p>To answer this, you have to determine <em>which bitcoin</em> you are disposing of in this scenario. <br/></p><p>To determine the order in which you sell various cryptocurrencies, accountants use specific <em>costing methods</em> like <a href="cryptocurrency-tax-calculations-fifo-and-lifo-costing-methods-explained.html"><strong>First-In First-Out (FIFO) or Last-In First-Out (LIFO)</strong></a>. The standard method is First-in First-out.<br/></p><p>These costing methods work exactly how they sound. For <em>First-In First-Out</em>, the asset (or cryptocurrency) that you <em>purchased first</em> is the one that gets sold off first. So you are essentially disposing of your crypto in the same order that you first acquired them.<br/></p><p>If we use <em>First-In First Out </em>for our example above, we “sell off” that first bitcoin which was acquired at $12,000 on 1/1/20. The cost basis in this first bitcoin is $12,000, making the cost basis for 0.5 of this BTC $6,000 (0.5 * $12,000).<br/></p><p>As denoted in the example, the fair market value at the time of 0.5 BTC at the time of trading was $4,000.<br/></p><p>So by applying the formula, we can see that this transaction history triggers a <strong>$2,000 capital loss </strong>(4,000 - 6,000). This loss gets reported on your taxes and reduces your taxable income. <br/></p><p>You can learn more about how various costing methods work to calculate your gains and loss for your crypto trades in this blog post: <a href="cryptocurrency-tax-calculations-fifo-and-lifo-costing-methods-explained.html"><strong>FIFO, LIFO, and HIFO for crypto trading</strong></a>.</p><p>&lt;div id=&quot;om-eeywu2knpo981nccukze-holder&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p><h2>The challenge for crypto traders</h2><p>As you can see throughout the examples above, to calculate your capital gains and losses from your crypto trading activity, you need to have records that keep track of your cost basis, fair market value, and USD gain or loss every time you <em>dispose</em> of a crypto (trade, sell, spend etc).<br/></p><p>Without this information, you aren’t able to calculate your realized income from your trading activity, and you aren’t able to report it on your taxes.<br/></p><p>This is extremely challenging for many cryptocurrency investors as most haven’t been keeping detailed records of their investing activity.

The agency has sent tens of thousands of <a href="irs-sending-more-cryptocurrency-warning-letters.html"><strong>warning and action letters</strong></a> to Coinbase users suspected of inaccurate tax reporting. It has also <a href="irs-crypto-1040-update.html"><strong>updated the main US income tax form</strong></a> (1040) to include a question that every US taxpayer must answer under penalty of perjury:<br/></p><p><em>“At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”<br/></em></p><p>With this much scrutiny on the cryptocurrency asset class, it’s likely that we will see audits and criminal tax prosecutions continue to increase as cryptocurrency and bitcoin adoption accelerates.</p><h2>How do other countries handle crypto taxes?</h2><p>Similar to the U.S., countries all over the world have started taking action and enforcing cryptocurrency-related income taxes. While the tax rules are very similar to the U.S., small differences do exist. For more detailed information, check out our guides on various countries below:<br/></p><ul role="list"><li><a href="australia-cryptocurrency-taxes-guide.html"><strong>Australia Crypto Taxes</strong></a></li><li><a href="canada-cryptocurrency-taxes.html"><strong>Canada Crypto Taxes</strong></a></li><li><a href="uk-crypto-tax-guide.html"><strong>UK Crypto Taxes<br/>‍</strong></a></li></ul><h2>How do you lower your crypto taxes?</h2><p>As with any other form of income, there are certain steps and actions you can take to actively minimize your cryptocurrency-related tax obligations. We discuss some of these strategies below.</p><h3><strong>Tax loss harvesting</strong></h3><p>Tax loss harvesting is the practice of selling a capital asset at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability. It provides one of the best opportunities for investors to reduce their cryptocurrency gains for the year. <br/></p><p><strong>Example:</strong><br/></p><p>Amy has realized $15,000 of capital gains by selling her bitcoin at its height this year. Amy is also still holding an amount of XRP in her portfolio which she originally purchased for $12,000. Today, that amount of XRP is worth only $5,000.<br/></p><p>In this scenario, Amy can “harvest” her losses in XRP by selling it or by trading into another cryptocurrency. This <em>triggers a taxable event</em> and realizes $7,000 of capital losses (12,000 - 5,000).<br/></p><p>Amy’s $7,000 loss reduces her overall capital gains for the year to $8,000 (15,000 - 7,000).<br/></p><p>You can use the CryptoTrader.Tax Tax Loss Harvesting Dashboard (as pictured below) to automatically detect which assets in your crypto portfolio are “underwater” and thus present the best tax loss harvesting opportunities. <br/></p><p>Learn more about how you can <a href="cryptocurrency-tax-loss-harvesting.html"><strong>tax loss harvest with cryptocurrency here</strong></a>. </p><h3><strong>Long term capital gains</strong></h3><p>For any significant cryptocurrency gains that you plan to realize, you should see if you have the ability to lock in long term capital gains rates. <br/></p><p>Remember, long term capital gains apply for crypto that is held for longer than 1 year, and they offer significantly lower tax rates when compared to short term gains.<br/></p><p>Prior to selling or trading, you should review your portfolio to see which assets qualify for long term gains and which do not. This is a great strategy to help lower your cryptocurrency tax bill for the year.</p><h2>What if you forgot to report your crypto taxes?</h2><p>If you’re like many other crypto investors, there’s a strong chance that you weren’t always aware of the fact that your crypto-related income needed to be reported on your taxes. <br/></p><p>If you are in this situation, don’t stress out. You can amend a prior year&#x27;s tax return to include your crypto-related income with <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040x"><strong>IRS Form 1040X</strong></a>.<br/></p><p>Many cryptocurrency investors go through this process without issue, and it’s always better to amend your return in good faith rather than waiting for the IRS to find you.<br/></p><p>For a detailed guide, checkout our blog post on <a href="what-to-do-if-you-forgot-to-report-your-crypto-trades-on-last-years-tax-return.html"><strong>how to amend your tax return to include your crypto</strong></a>.</p><p>‍</p><figure style="max-width:60%" class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../../assets.website-files.com/5f9c358b57fa1ea8ea314144/6065cfc0ae57d8c0ece87ced_5fda3b2380acdb876371495c_The%2520Challenge%2520For%2520Crypto%2520Traders.png" loading="lazy" alt="Other cryptocurrency transactions"/></div></figure><h2>Other cryptocurrency transactions and tax examples</h2><h3><strong>How are airdrops taxed?</strong></h3><p>Cryptocurrency received from an airdrop is taxed as income. This means that you are liable for income taxes on the USD value of the claimed airdrop.<br/></p><p>The IRS is clear in its <a href="new-irs-cryptocurrency-tax-guidance.html"><strong>guidance</strong></a> regarding the income treatment of airdrops.<br/></p><p><strong>Example:</strong><br/></p><p>George receives 400 UNI tokens via the Uniswap airdrop in September 2020. At the time of receiving the tokens, UNI was trading at $3.50.<br/></p><p>In this example, George realizes $1,400 of income (400 * 3.50) when he claims the tokens. His cost basis in UNI becomes the amount of income recognized, in this case $1,400.<br/></p><p>If George sells his 400 UNI two months later for $2,000, this is a taxable event and he incurs a capital gain of $600 (2,000 - 1,400).</p><h3><strong>How are hard forks taxed?</strong></h3><p>If a certain cryptocurrency that you are holding goes through a hard fork which “occurs when a cryptocurrency undergoes a protocol change resulting in a permanent diversion from the legacy distributed ledger,” the new forked cryptocurrency you receive is taxed as income. <br/></p><p>Your cost basis in the newly received cryptocurrency becomes the income you recognize.<br/></p><p><strong>Example: </strong><br/></p><p>Megan held 2.5 Bitcoin in July of 2017 and received 2.5 Bitcoin Cash as a result of the bitcoin cash hard fork.<br/></p><p>Megan recognizes income at the fair market value of the bitcoin cash at the time it was received. If Bitcoin Cash was trading for $500/BCH that day, Megan would recognize income of $1,250 ($500 * 2.5). Megan’s cost basis in this Bitcoin Cash becomes $1,250.</p><h3><strong>How is crypto interest taxed?</strong></h3><p>Mitchell lends out his crypto and receives interest rewards for doing so. In September, Mitchell earns 0.2 ETH in interest from lending out his Ethereum. At the time of earning this reward, 0.2 ETH is worth $120.<br/></p><p>In this scenario, Mitchell recognizes $120 of ordinary income from his ETH interest earnings.</p><h3><strong>How is margin trading taxed?</strong></h3><p>Cryptocurrency exchanges like BitMex have popularized the use of margin trading. The IRS has not yet set forth explicit guidance on how cryptocurrency margin transactions should be handled from a tax perspective, but we can infer the likely treatment based on other guidance.<br/></p><p>A margin trade consists of borrowing funds from an exchange to carry out a trade and repaying the loan afterwards. The conservative approach is to treat the borrowed funds as your own investment and pay capital gains tax on the margin trading profit and loss.</p><h3><strong>How are crypto gifts taxed?</strong></h3><p>Gifting is tax-free up to $15,000 per friend or family member. This offers a great way to save on your taxes if you are feeling generous.</p><h3><strong>How are crypto donations taxed?</strong></h3><p>Donating your crypto is tax free and deductible as long as you are donating to a registered charity.<br/></p><p>Donations greater than $500 have to be reported on <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8283.pdf"><strong>Form 8283</strong></a>.<br/></p><p>The amount of your donation that is tax deductible depends on how long you have held the assets:<br/></p><ul role="list"><li>For crypto held for more than 1 year, you can deduct up to 30% of your Annual Gross Income</li><li>For crypto held for less than a year, you can deduct up to 50% of your Annual Gross Income and the lesser of cost-basis or the fair market value of the donated crypto<br/>‍</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The entire cryptocurrency ecosystem is still in its infancy.
